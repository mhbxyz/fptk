"""State[S, A] â€” pure stateful computations.

Use ``State`` when you need to model computations that read and write to some
mutable state without actually mutating anything. It's great for workflows that
need to track state changes purely, like parsers, game logic, or complex
transformations with intermediate state.

The ``State[S, A]`` monad represents computations that take an initial state
``S``, produce a value ``A``, and leave a final state ``S``. It's a function
``S -> (A, S)`` wrapped in a monadic interface.

Everyday usage
- ``map(f)`` transforms the result while preserving state transitions.
- ``bind(f)`` chains computations that can read/write state; state is threaded
  through automatically.
- ``run(initial_state)`` executes and returns (value, final_state).
- ``get()`` gets the current state as a State[S, S].
- ``put(new_state)`` sets the state to a new value, discarding the old.
- ``modify(f)`` applies a function to update the state.

Interop and practicality
- State composes well with ``Result`` for stateful computations that can fail
  (e.g., ``State[S, Result[A, E]]``).
- Use ``gets(f)`` to extract and transform the current state without changing it.
- Instances are immutable and hashable; equality compares the underlying functions.
- Minimal overhead: just function wrapping.

Quick examples

    >>> from fptk.adt.state import State, get, put, modify
    >>> s = get().map(lambda x: x + 1)
    >>> s.run(5)
    (6, 5)
    >>> put(10).bind(lambda _: get()).run(0)
    (10, 10)
    >>> modify(lambda x: x * 2).run(3)
    ((), 6)
    >>> get().bind(lambda x: modify(lambda _: x + 1)).run(2)
    ((), 3)
